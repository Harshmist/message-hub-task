# message-hub-task

## Requirements

Design and build a message hub that can accept and distribute messages to connected users who are subscribed to a certain "topic".
Think of this like a chat room that is connected to either via TCP.

## Considerations

- How will you handle users potentially publishing messages at the same time?
- Will you have only a single topic for users or will they be able to create their own topics for users to subscribe to?
